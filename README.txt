Based on this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/conways-reverse-game-of-life-2020/overview

Data is also from the same kaggle page

Current directory has my own failed attempt at a solution

./kaggle_ensemble/ensemble_predictions contains the ensemble implementation

NOTE: ./kaggle_ensemble directory contains the beginning of a more wholistic ensemble based solution
that actually implements each model individually for further training.
